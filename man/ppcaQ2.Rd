\title{Cross-validation for PCA}
\usage{
ppcaQ2(obj, originalData = pcaMethods::completeObs(obj$pcaMethodsRes),
  fold = 5, nruncv = 1, type = c("krzanowski", "impute"),
  verbose = interactive(),
  variables = 1:(pcaMethods::nVar(obj$pcaMethodsRes)), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{originalData}{The matrix (or ExpressionSet) that used to
obtain the pcaRes object.}

\item{fold}{The number of groups to divide the data in.}

\item{nruncv}{The number of times to repeat the whole
cross-validation}

\item{type}{krzanowski or imputation type cross-validation}

\item{verbose}{\code{boolean} If TRUE Q2 outputs a primitive
progress bar.}

\item{variables}{indices of the variables to use during
cross-validation calculation. Other variables are kept as they are
and do not contribute to the total sum-of-squares.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to the \code{\link{pca}} function called
within Q2.}

\item{object}{A \code{pcaRes} object (result from previous PCA
analysis.)}
}
\value{
A matrix or vector with \eqn{Q^2} estimates.
}
\description{
Internal cross-validation can be used for estimating the level of
structure in a data set and to optimise the choice of number of
principal components.
}
\details{
This method calculates \eqn{Q^2} for a PCA model. This is the
cross-validated version of \eqn{R^2} and can be interpreted as the
ratio of variance that can be predicted independently by the PCA
model. Poor (low) \eqn{Q^2} indicates that the PCA model only
describes noise and that the model is unrelated to the true data
structure. The definition of \eqn{Q^2} is: \deqn{Q^2=1 -
\frac{\sum_{i}^{k}\sum_{j}^{n}(x -
\hat{x})^2}{\sum_{i}^{k}\sum_{j}^{n}x^2}}{Q^2=1 - sum_i^k
sum_j^n (x - \hat{x})^2 / \sum_i^k \sum_j^n(x^2)} for the matrix
\eqn{x} which has \eqn{n} rows and \eqn{k} columns. For a given
number of PC's x is estimated as \eqn{\hat{x}=TP'} (T are scores
and P are loadings). Although this defines the leave-one-out
cross-validation this is  not what is performed if fold is less
than the number of rows and/or columns.  In 'impute' type CV,
diagonal rows of elements in the matrix are deleted and the
re-estimated.  In 'krzanowski' type CV, rows are sequentially left
out to build fold PCA models which give the loadings. Then,
columns are sequentially left out to build fold models for
scores. By combining scores and loadings from different models, we
can estimate completely left out values.  The two types may seem
similar but can give very different results, krzanowski typically
yields more stable and reliable result for estimating data
structure whereas impute is better for evaluating missing value
imputation performance. Note that since Krzanowski CV operates on
a reduced matrix, it is not possible estimate Q2 for all
components and the result vector may therefore be shorter than
\code{nPcs(object)}.
